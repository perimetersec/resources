## Special and/or sensitive personal data we process
Our website and/or service does not intend to collect data about website visitors who are under 16 years of age, unless they have permission from parents or guardians. However, we cannot verify whether a visitor is over 16. We therefore recommend that parents be involved in the online activities of their children to prevent data about children from being collected without parental consent. If you believe that we have collected personal data about a minor without this consent, please contact us via [info@perimetersec.io](mailto:info@perimetersec.io), and we will delete this information.

- To deliver goods and services to you
- Perimeter also processes personal data if we are legally obliged to do so, such as data we need for our tax return.

## Automated decision-making
Perimeter makes decisions based on automated processing about matters that can have (significant) consequences for individuals. These are decisions made by computer programs or systems without human intervention (for example, a Perimeter employee). Perimeter uses the following computer programs or systems:
- Moneybird

Perimeter does not keep your personal data longer than is strictly necessary to achieve the purposes for which your data is collected. We use the following retention periods for the following (categories of) personal data: 3 years.

## Viewing, modifying, or deleting data
You have the right to view, correct, or delete your personal data. In addition, you have the right to withdraw your consent to the data processing or to object to the processing of your personal data by Perimeter, and you have the right to data portability. This means that you can submit a request to us to send the personal data we hold about you in a computer file to you or another organization mentioned by you.

You can send a request for access, correction, deletion, data transfer of your personal data, or request to withdraw your consent or objection to the processing of your personal data to [info@perimetersec.io](mailto:info@perimetersec.io).

To ensure that the request for access has been made by you, we ask you to send a copy of your identity document with the request. In this copy, make your passport photo, MRZ (machine-readable zone, the strip with numbers at the bottom of the passport), passport number, and Citizen Service Number (BSN) black. This is to protect your privacy. We will respond to your request as soon as possible, but within four weeks.

This can be done via the following link: [https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/en/contact-dutch-dpa/contact-us](https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/en/contact-dutch-dpa/contact-us).
