## About
Perimeter's mission is to deliver the highest quality fuzzing services to protocols by uniting the world's foremost fuzzing specialists. We possess extensive expertise in fuzzing a diverse range of protocols, from smaller, niche protocols to some of the largest and most complex in DeFi. 

In order to deliver on our mission, we have developed the most advanced scaffolding and libraries, enabling us to create highly sophisticated fuzzing suites tailored to meet the unique challenges of each protocol. We have enterprise hardware and cloud infrastructure with [Recon](https://getrecon.xyz) to support the demands of these sophisticated fuzzing suites. Additionally, [Perimeter Essentials](../services/Perimeter%20Essentials.md) helps protocols new to fuzzing get started quickly.

## Testimonials
Below are some testimonials of our prior work.

> I engaged 0xScourgedev for fuzz testing on behalf of Pendle, and I was impressed with his dedication and willingness to go above and beyond. He was very responsive and committed to delivering quality results, consistently addressing any queries or concerns promptly. Overall, 0xScourgedev did a great job ensuring the robustness of the contract. We look forward to working with him again in the future.
