# Rappie

## About
Rappie is the Founder of Perimeter and an Associate Security Researcher at Spearbit, with a strong background in fuzzing acquired through private engagements and successes in finding vulnerabilities through bug bounties. Rappie has successfully completed an engagement for a protocol with an 8-figure TVL, which led to multiple successful follow-up engagements.

A notable engagement with Spearbit showcased Rappie as the fuzzing expert on the team, where the client expressed significant satisfaction with the fuzzing work performed, leading to a successful follow-up fuzzing engagement.

Beyond professional engagements, Rappie is active in the fuzzing community, contributing to its growth through various means, including writing exercises for people learning Echidna, an example of which can be seen at: [https://github.com/crytic/building-secure-contracts/pull/143](https://github.com/crytic/building-secure-contracts/pull/143 "https://github.com/crytic/building-secure-contracts/pull/143").
