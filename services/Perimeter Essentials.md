## Getting Started with Fuzzing
Getting started with fuzzing for protocols can seem daunting, despite its clear [benefits](https://github.com/perimetersec/resources/blob/main/services/Benefits%20of%20Fuzzing.md#use-cases-of-fuzzing). There is often uncertainty surrounding cost, timelines, and potential issues. Additionally, creating an effective fuzzing suite presents numerous [technical challenges](https://github.com/perimetersec/resources/blob/main/services/Benefits%20of%20Fuzzing.md#challenges-of-fuzzing).

At Perimeter, we strive to make fuzzing accessible for every protocol. To achieve this, we offer an Essentials package designed to provide protocols with a solid, highly extensible foundation that meets long-term security needs and effectively prevents exploits.

## What is Perimeter's Essentials package?
Our Essentials package offers a quick, **one-week**, **discounted** engagement, providing the following deliverables designed to establish a solid foundation that can be expanded upon while effectively preventing exploits:

- **Invariant Development:** We will collaborate with you to identify the most mission-critical parts of the code, establishing invariants and handlers to ensure robust performance.
- **Findings Reporting:** Provide thorough documentation and reporting of all findings identified throughout the engagement period.
- **Efficient Fuzzing Suite:** To maximize efficiency, we will implement clamping, optimizing the fuzzing suiteâ€™s operations.
- **Proof-of-Concept Development:** For each finding and assertion/property counterexample identified, a corresponding Proof-of-Concept (PoC) will be developed to demonstrate potential vulnerabilities and their implications.
- **Invariant Testing Assurance:** Our team will execute the fuzzing suite for a minimum of 10,000,000 runs, ensuring thorough testing and analysis.
- **Comprehensive Final Report:** This detailed final report will include all findings, along with their corresponding PoCs. It will also detail the invariants tested, their run status, and the number of runs, providing a comprehensive overview of the engagement's outcomes.

To be able to offer this cost-effective and swift service, there are some preconditions to be met:
- The codebase must be able to compile
- There is a foundry setup file containing all of the contract deployments
- Slither must be executable on the codebase
